- **Authentic KP Methodology**: Follows traditional Krishnamurti Paddhati principles

### 2. **Probability Scoring System**
- **High Scoring Probability**: Based on benefic planets and 5th house strength (0-100%)
- **Collapse Probability**: Based on malefic planets and 8th house significance (0-100%)
- **Wicket Pressure Probability**: Calculated from planetary tensions and aspects (0-100%)
- **Momentum Shift Probability**: Derived from sub lord changes and planetary transitions (0-100%)

### 3. **Ascendant/Descendant Validation**
- **Performance-Based Validation**: Analyzes historical match outcomes vs KP predictions
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides validation confidence levels (0-1 scale)
- **Automatic Assignment Correction**: Flips team assignments when cosmic analysis indicates

### 4. **Enhanced Training System**

## 🎲 **KP Astrological Principles Applied**

### **House Significances for Cricket**
- **1st House**: Ascendant team strength, overall vitality
- **5th House**: Sports, entertainment, creative expression  
- **6th House**: Competition, opponents, daily struggles
- **7th House**: Opposition team, partnerships, open enemies
- **8th House**: Obstacles, wickets, sudden changes, defeats
- **10th House**: Success, achievement, reputation, career
- **11th House**: Gains, profits, fulfillment of desires
- **12th House**: Losses, expenses, hidden enemies, endings

### **Planetary Classifications**
- **Benefics**: Jupiter (wisdom), Venus (harmony)
- **Malefics**: Saturn (obstacles), Mars (aggression), Sun (authority), Rahu/Ketu (karmic nodes)
- **Neutrals**: Moon (mind), Mercury (communication)

### **KP Hierarchy** (Most to Least Important)
1. **Cuspal Sub Lord** (60% weight)
2. **Planet in House** (25% weight) 
3. **Aspecting Planets** (15% weight)

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Astrological Period Calculation**
```python
def find_next_sub_lord_change(current_time, current_chart):
    # Get moon position and speed from Swiss Ephemeris
    moon_long = get_moon_longitude(current_time)
    moon_speed = get_moon_speed(current_time)
    
    # Find current sub lord boundaries
    current_sub_lord_end = find_sub_lord_boundary(moon_long)
    
    # Calculate time to reach next boundary
    degrees_to_travel = current_sub_lord_end - moon_long
    minutes_to_change = (degrees_to_travel / moon_speed) * 24 * 60
    
    return current_time + timedelta(minutes=minutes_to_change)
```

### **Probability Score Calculation**
```python
def calculate_probability_scores(chart, favorability):
    # High Scoring Probability (0-1 scale)
    high_scoring = calculate_high_scoring_probability(chart, favorability)
    
    # Collapse Probability (0-1 scale)
    collapse = calculate_collapse_probability(chart, favorability)
    
    # Wicket Pressure Probability (0-1 scale)
    wicket_pressure = calculate_wicket_pressure_probability(chart, favorability)
    
    # Momentum Shift Probability (0-1 scale)
    momentum_shift = calculate_momentum_shift_probability(chart, favorability)
    
    return {
        'high_scoring_probability': high_scoring,
        'collapse_probability': collapse,
        'wicket_pressure_probability': wicket_pressure,
        'momentum_shift_probability': momentum_shift
    }
```

### **Feature Engineering with Periods**
```python
# Weight KP scores by actual period duration
weighted_kp_score = sum(
    score * duration for score, duration 
    in zip(kp_scores, period_durations)
) / total_duration

# Count favorable periods by duration
ascendant_duration_ratio = sum(
    duration for score, duration in zip(kp_scores, period_durations) 
    if score > 0.1
) / total_duration
```
